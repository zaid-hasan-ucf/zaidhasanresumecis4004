        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I've went ahead and created three virtual machines to represent an Active Directory domain environment. In this environment, there were three computers attached to the domain: one domain controller, one file server, and one client PC.
         In the sample screenshot above, I went ahead and created a couple of user accounts to test security groups and user permissions.</p>
         <h2>Skills:</h2>
         <p>In this project, I learned more about Windows Server OS along with getting an idea of how to modify a Windows Domain. This will be necessary in a Systems
            Administrator role.</p>
