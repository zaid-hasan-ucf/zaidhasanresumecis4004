        <h1>Project 2: Home Network Revamp</h1>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p> In this project, I overhauled my home network security system by seperating my wireless networks and segmenting them into different VLANs. For example, primary household wifi, guest wifi, and 
            IoT devices were all segmented. Through this process, I implemented different traffic flow rules across these VLANs and also introduced mDNS reflection for AirPrint compatibiltiy across
            seperate networks.</p>
         <h2>Skills:</h2>
         <p>I learned more about managing a home network along with best practice rules for securing/hardening a network and ensuring proper auditing/logging of events. I also gained a better understanding of different communication
            network ports and what services they are commonly used by.</p>
